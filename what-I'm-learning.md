## What I'm learning
##### *Projects, advanced use cases, and more granular technicals of web3*

## Roll-ups
#### 
* Optimistic
    - Assumes state changes are valid, posts tx to ETH's L1
    - Dispute period:
        - 3rd parties can publish fraud proofs
        - _fidelity bonds_: 
    - 
* Zero Knowledge (ZKs)
    - uses _validity proofs_: txs are rolled up (L2 batches multiple txs, sends to mainnet, aka L1, as a single tx)
#### *more coming soon...*
